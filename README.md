PICOGRID: autonomous house

project of 4th year of electrical engineering at the INSA of Strasbourg

we're creating a solar powered house with a fridge, a rice coocker, usb socket and light.

5 microcontroller will communicate together and with a Raspberry pi 4 through CAN bus. 
This will allow users to control the various devices in the house with a web interface.

We're using PIC18F27Q84 as microcontroller
